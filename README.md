[vim-cmake](https://github.com/Squareys/vim-cmake) is a Vim plugin to make working with CMake a lot more convenient.
This project was originally forked from [vhdirk/vim-cmake](https://github.com/vhdirk/vim-cmake).

## Usage

### Commands

 * `:CMake` searches for the closest directory named build in an upwards search,
and whenever one is found, it runs the cmake command there, assuming the CMakeLists.txt
file is just one directory above. Any arguments given to :CMake will be directly passed
on to the cmake command. It also sets the working directory of the make command, so
you can just use quickfix as with a normal Makefile project.

 * `:CMakeClean` deletes all files in the build directory. You can think of this as a CMake version of make clean.

 * `:CMakeFindBuildDir` resets the build directory path set for the current buffer and then tries to find a new one. Useful if it previously found a wrong path to then reset it after a new build folder has been created for example.

### Variables

 * `g:cmake_install_prefix` same as `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`

 * `g:cmake_build_type` same as `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`

 * `g:cmake_cxx_compiler` same as `-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER`. Changes will have no effect until you run :CMakeClean and then :CMake.

 * `g:cmake_c_compiler` same as `-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER`. Changes will have no effect until you run :CMakeClean and then :CMake.

 * `g:cmake_build_shared_libs` same as `-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS`

 * `g:cmake_project_generator` same as `-G`. Changes will have no effect until you run :CMakeClean and then :CMake.

 * `g:cmake_export_compile_commands` same as `-DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS`.

 * `g:cmake_ycm_symlinks` create symlinks to the generated compilation database for use with [YouCompleteMe](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe/).

 * `b:build_dir` is the path to the cmake build directory for the current buffer. This variable is set with the first :CMake or :CMakeFindBuildDir call. Once found, it will not be searched for again unless you call :CMakeFindBuildDir. If automatic finding is not sufficient you can set this variable manually to the build dir of your choice.


## Installation


### Vim-pathogen

With [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) simply copy and paste:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone git://github.com/Squareys/vim-cmake.git

Once help tags have been generated, you can view the manual with
`:help cmake`.

### Vundle

With [Vundle.vim](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) simply add this repository to your plugins list:

    Plugin 'Squareys/vim-cmake'

## Contributing

If you find bugs or annoyances while using vim-cmake, go ahead and open an [issue](https://github.com/Squareys/vim-cmake/issues), or fix it yourself and open a [pullrequest](https://github.com/Squareys/vim-cmake/pulls).

### Running tests

vim-cmake uses [vader.vim](https://github.com/junegunn/vader.vim) for testing. To run the tests you will need to clone the repository into the root of this project:

```
# Clone the repo, note: on unix make sure the created folder is lowercase!
git clone https://github.com/junegunn/vader.vim

# Run tests
vim -Nu 'test/.vimrc' -c 'Vader! test/cmake.vader'
vim -Nu 'test/.vimrc' -c 'Vader! test/cmake_quickfix.vader'
```

For test file syntax highlighting, add vader.vim as a plugin to your .vimrc.
